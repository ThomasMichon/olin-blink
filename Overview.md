### A programmable light-show interface ###

Blink is a distributed network-based platform for creating and performing light shows. Imagine a large building with strings of mini-lights in each window. With blink, we will be able to coordinate the state of the lights and synchronize it to music.

### Project Components ###

Blink has a few main components:

  * **Core**: classes that serve the runtime and allow for a common means of communication
  * **Network**: manages network timing and cue distribution
  * **Client**: interacts with hardware to run the show at a single client
  * **Editor**: creates light-shows in an intuitive timeline-based user interface
