Using a simple, user-oriented GUI and a client-server network architecture, Lightshow enables the rapid creation of lightshows.  Olin-Blink is designed for use in an environment where multiple computers are responsible for communicating to a master server.  Each client computer controls one or more illumination devices (e.g., stranded lights) in accordance with the overall program as designed by the end user.  Creation of a show is done with a graphical representation of the actual lighting layout attached to a timeline.
